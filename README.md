# UP-Cebu-Queuery-System

CMSC 126 Hackathon Project with the theme "Make UP Cebu Better". Our team "Bayaning Third-wheels", decided to create queuery system for UP Cebu. It has been a problem of students in UP Cebu of waiting in long lines and not being able to be serve because of too much people or not having enough time.
